## 📌 Overview

 **ORIENT** is a ball-balancing **3-RRS (Revolute-Revolute-Spherical)** Platform. It can dynamically balance a ball in real time and perform motion tasks such as moving in straight lines, quadrants, and even circles. The robot uses real-time computer vision, inverse kinematics, and PID control for its operation.

## 🔧 Tools & Concepts Used

- Python
- OpenCV (Contour Detection, HSV Tuning)
- Inverse Kinematics (for 3-RRS)
- PID Control
