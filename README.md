## üìå Overview

 **ORIENT** is a ball-balancing **3-RRS (Revolute-Revolute-Spherical)** Platform. It can dynamically balance a ball in real time and perform motion tasks such as moving in straight lines, quadrants, and even circles. The robot uses real-time computer vision, inverse kinematics, and PID control for its operation.

## üîß Tools & Concepts Used

- Python
- OpenCV (Contour Detection, HSV Tuning)
- Inverse Kinematics (for 3-RRS)
- PID Control

## üßÆ Inverse Kinematics [(Notes)](https://github.com/NishitMittal2004/Orient_Ball_Balancing_Robot/blob/main/Inverse%20Kinematics%20Maths.pdf)

We derived and implemented the IK for the 3-RRS platform to calculate the exact servo angles required to achieve desired platform tilt and height. This allowed precise control over the ball's motion.

## üëÅÔ∏è Ball Detection with OpenCV

- HSV Trackbar for color tuning
- `cv2.findContours` and `cv2.minEnclosingCircle` to detect the ball
- Real-time position and area returned for control logic

---

## üéõÔ∏è PID Tuning

After exhaustive tuning and testing, a finely tuned PID controller was implemented, keeping the ball at centre.
